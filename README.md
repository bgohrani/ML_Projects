# Machine Learning Projects


## Hey There!

This repository contains some of my work on picking up skills relating to commonly used Machine Learning libraries such as Sklearn. The code I've put up here is some of my practice work while studying and implementing the popular guide, Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow - Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems, by Aurélien Géron.
